# Setup

First, let’s make sure that your development environment is ready.

- If you don’t have Node.js installed, install it from here. You’ll need Node.js version 10.13 or later.
  You’ll be using your own text editor and terminal app for this tutorial.
- If you are on Windows, we recommend downloading Git for Windows and use Git Bash that comes with it, which supports the UNIX-specific commands in this tutorial. Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is another option.

## Create a Next.js app

To create a Next.js app, open your terminal, cd into the directory you’d like to create the app in, and run the following command:

<CH.Section>

```shellscript
npx create-next-app nextjs-blog --use-npm --example "https://github.com/vercel/next-learn/tree/master/basics/learn-starter"
```

Something _`def lorem(ipsum)`_

```typescript NavBar.tsx
#from ./code.ts
